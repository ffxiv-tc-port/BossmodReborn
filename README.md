BossmodReborn is a community-driven fork of the original Bossmod plugin for Final Fantasy XIV. It aims to enhance your gameplay by providing real-time tactical guidance and tools that simplify complex raid mechanics. This tool is invaluable for optimizing in-game strategies, ensuring precise positioning, and enhancing overall raid performance.

## Features

- **Advanced Radar System**: A sophisticated on-screen map displaying player and boss positions, imminent AOEs, and other crucial mechanics. This system helps players visualize the battlefield, simplifying decision-making processes.
- **Mechanic Descriptors**: Near the radar, you’ll find clear, concise descriptions of upcoming mechanics, global hints for resolving current challenges, and personalized player advice to optimize your response to each situation.
- **Cooldown Planner**: A tool for meticulous planning of ability usage, ensuring optimal timing for cooldowns and abilities in coordination with raid strategies.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with accessibility in mind with a wonderful module viewer by Croizat, the interface is intuitive, allowing players of all skill levels to benefit from the plugin.
- **Regular Updates**: Committed to staying current with the latest game patches, class updates, and community feedback. PRs will be reviewed, tested, and approved.

## Localization

UI strings can be localized via `Loc.T("Key", "English fallback")` (see [BossMod/Util/Loc.cs](BossMod/Util/Loc.cs)), backed by per-language JSON files in `BossMod/loc/` (e.g. `tw.json`). Missing keys/languages fall back to the English text passed as the second argument, so translations can be added incrementally.

## Build versioning

The build number (last segment of `<Version>` in [BossMod/BossModReborn.csproj](BossMod/BossModReborn.csproj)) is auto-incremented after every build by [BossMod/increment_version.ps1](BossMod/increment_version.ps1). This is expected — a modified `.csproj` after a local build is usually just this bump, not a manual edit.

## Fork for CN client
- A fork for players on the CN client can be found on https://github.com/44451516-ff14/BossmodRebornCN.
- It is not directly supported by the Combat Reborn Team, so any bugs exclusive to that fork need to be fixed by the fork maintainer.
- Bugs that likely affect both BossmodReborn and the CN fork can still be reported to the Combat Reborn Team.
